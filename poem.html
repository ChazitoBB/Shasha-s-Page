        <h1>Poem For The Most beautiful Girl In The World</h1>
        <p id="poem-content">
            Your beauty is divine,
            From head to toe, you are simply sublime.
            Your legs, graceful and strong,
            A dance of elegance that moves me along.

            Your hands, so tender, so fair,
            Crafting dreams with a delicate flair.
            Your face, a canvas of pure grace,
            Each feature, a masterpiece in its place.

            Your eyes, sparkling like the brightest stars,
            Holding mysteries, deep and far.
            Your nose, perfectly designed,
            A touch of heaven, so refined.

            Your hair, soft, silky, and bright,
            A flowing river of golden light.
            And oh, your lips, so full, so sweet,
            A treasure I long to meet.

            Every time I see you, I want to hide,
            Or run away, overwhelmed by your beauty so wide.
            I love admiring art, but I still canâ€™t decide,
            Did you fall from heaven or escape from a museum? For you are a masterpiece, with nothing to hide.

            I would die to taste your kiss,
            To feel the warmth, the bliss.
            Maybe by now, you've smiled,
            With that beautiful smile that drives me wild,
            That fascinates me, that I adore,
            And seeing it always makes me want more.

            For in those lips, I see my fate,
            A moment of love, I cannot wait.
