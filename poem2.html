            I love you, even though we are not and we are not.

But we were and we were.
We were the right people,
with the wrong life.

We were the most beautiful and sad way
that life had, to throw in our faces,
that we cannot have everything.

I know it and you know it.
You are my love for another life,
my love for another time.

You came too soon
and it was still too late.

You understood me more than anyone,
and there was no one,
who loved you more than me.

I have always believed that everything is possible
and that the impossible...
just takes a little more time.

But dear impossible love,
with you that theory is unnecessary.

Sometimes I feel that we were
unpunctual, or that destiny
was so infatuated
with us...
that it decided to put us a minute
late.

Maybe one person before
or one person after.

“WE WERE EVERYTHING AND WE WERE NOTHING”
